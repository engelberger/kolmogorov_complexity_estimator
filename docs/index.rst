Welcome to KolmogorovComplexityEstimatorPythonPackage's documentation!
=======================================================================

This package implements the Coding Theorem Method (CTM) for estimating Kolmogorov complexity based on the paper "Calculating Kolmogorov Complexity from the Output Frequency Distributions of Small Turing Machines" by Soler-Toscano et al.

**Key Features:**

* Turing machine simulation for the CTM approach
* Calculation of output frequency distributions D(n,m)
* Kolmogorov complexity estimation via the Coding Theorem
* Advanced reduction techniques for efficient enumeration
* Parallel execution support for high-performance computation
